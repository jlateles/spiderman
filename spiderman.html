                <p>
                    Morales was born and raised in Brooklyn, New York City, the then-13-year-old son of an African American father and a Puerto Rican mother.
                    When Marvel's editorial staff decided that the Ultimate universe's Peter Parker would be killed in the 2011 storyline "Death of Spider-Man",
                    the character Miles Morales was created, by writer Brian Michael Bendis and artist Sara Pichelli.
                    Axel Alonso has described Miles as an intelligent nerd with an aptitude for science similar to his predecessor, Peter Parker.
                    The character made his debut in the fourth issue of the Ultimate Fallout miniseries, which was released on August 3, 2011.
